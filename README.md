To run for development, you'll need two processes: one for the backend and one for the front end.

1. To run the front end, navigate to frontend and run 'npm start'
    You may need to run 'npm install' in that directory first on your first time running.
2. To run the backend, nagivate to backend and run 'uvicorn fast:app'
    You may need to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in that directory first on your first time running.
